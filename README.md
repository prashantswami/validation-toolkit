## Overview

**ValidationToolkit** is a lightweight, reusable .NET library for validating Indian data formats. It currently supports validation for:

- PAN (Permanent Account Number)
- Aadhar
- Indian Mobile Numbers

This library can be extended to add more validation functions, such as GSTIN, IFSC, and PIN code, as required.

---

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that you have the following installed:

- [.NET 6.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet)
- A GitHub account (for version control and publishing to NuGet)
- [NuGet.org Account](https://www.nuget.org/) (to publish the NuGet package)

---

## Creating the Project

Follow these steps to create the project:

1. **Create the project folder**:
   - Initialize a Git repository for version control.
   
2. **Create the solution**:
   - Create a new `.NET` solution for your project.

3. **Create the class library project**:
   - Create a new class library project where the validation logic will reside.

4. **Create the test project**:
   - Create a test project using xUnit for unit testing the validation methods.

5. **Add a reference from the test project to the library**:
   - Add a reference from the test project to the main library project.

---

## Adding Validators

1. **Create the Validators Folder**:
   - Inside the `src/ValidationToolkit/Validators/` folder, create a file for implementing the validation methods.

2. **Implement validation functions**:
   - Write methods to validate Indian formats like PAN, Aadhar, and mobile numbers.

---

## Testing the Project

1. **Create Test Files**:
   - Create unit tests inside `tests/ValidationToolkit.Tests/` using xUnit.

2. **Run the tests**:
   - Run the tests using the command `dotnet test` to ensure your validation methods are working as expected.

---

## Building and Packing the NuGet Package

1. **Clean the build**:
   - Run `dotnet clean` to ensure no previous build artifacts remain.

2. **Build the project**:
   - Build the project using `dotnet build --configuration Release`.

3. **Pack the NuGet package**:
   - Use the command `dotnet pack --configuration Release --output ./nupkgs` to generate the `.nupkg` file.

---

## Publishing the Package

To publish the package to **NuGet**, follow these steps:

1. **Get an API Key from NuGet.org**:
   - Go to [NuGet.org](https://www.nuget.org/) and create an account to get the API key.

2. **Publish the package**:
   - Use `dotnet nuget push` to push your `.nupkg` file to NuGet.org.
